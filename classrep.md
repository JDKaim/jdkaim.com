**My 8th Grade Representative Campaign**

In the Spring of 2018, I decided to run for 8th Grade Class Representative at Redmond Middle School. This was my first time running for a class representative position, but I decided to run as a satirical nominee. My “position” was strictly opposed to 5th graders coming to the middle school as students while in 5th grade, although by the time they came to the middle school, they’d be 6th graders.
	
The format of the election was this. Each candidate got to submit 3 posters (to be hung up by the Leadership 2 class) and give a speech in front of the rest of the class (~300 students) on why they should be elected. Of course, there were still other requirements to be elected, which included a teacher interview and 50 signatures from fellow students who wanted you to run for rep. I managed to easily get the 50 signatures, and was quickly on my way to creating my three posters.

I made the posters by putting die-cut characters onto poster board, with each of the three posters having a large 5 inside a circle with a line through it front and center. This was the eye-catching part of the poster, intended to be something that students would be confused by before the speeches, but completely understand after the speeches. I had to turn them into the Leadership 2 classroom, and the Leadership 2 teacher, who will play a prominent role in this story, asked me what it was about, and laughed it off when I said that it would be “a surprise.”

For the speech, I intended to say that 5th graders shouldn’t come to the middle school as 5th graders, and I also wanted to suggest “building a wall” around Redmond Middle School to keep the 5th graders out, which would have been an obvious satirical gesture. The only problem with this is that I had to get my speech approved, and the person that would approve the speeches was the Leadership 2 teacher. Needless to say, she didn’t like my initial speech, and had me write a new one.

At this point, the speech assembly is just a couple days away. I did the teacher interview, where there were like 3 teachers and 2 current 8th graders asking me what I’d do and why I’d be a good fit. I did the interview completely seriously, and I ended up passing.

Although my initial speech was rejected, I was not deterred, and I continued to practice it. Instead of reading my original speech, I decided that I would start off by reading a strait-laced speech, and then I’d rip it up and continue with my original speech.

The day came. The date was Tuesday, May 8, 2018. The day of the speeches. I submitted a serious speech, and the Leadership 2 teacher approved it. At this point, everything was in place. I had submitted my posters, done the interview, and submitted my speech “script.” My final period of the day was Leadership 2, and yes, I did have the Leadership 2 teacher for my final period of every day. After the period ended, all the 7th graders began to shuffle into the gym for the speech ceremony.

My time to speak came, and I went up to the podium at the center of the gym, bringing my “speech,” and looked towards all of my fellow classmen. I had memorized the speech by heart, but I still pretended to read it for the first two sentences, saddened and demoralized. I suddenly showed a change of heart, and held up the speech, ripping it up in front of all my fellow 7th graders, and believe me, they went crazy. I then continued my speech, and began talking about 5th graders and why they shouldn’t be allowed to come to our school as 5th graders.

The Leadership 2 teacher was enraged, decided to come up to the podium, and asked me if I wanted to continue reading what she had approved. Holding my ground, I decided to not continue speaking, and went back to my seat, with the next kid coming up to speak.

After the speech, I wanted to make sure that no one thought that I was disqualified from the election, and decided to make a speech follow-up video, which I released later that day by emailing some kids and getting them to forward the link to the video.

Voting day came, and I decisively won, and the vice principal prevented the Leadership 2 teacher from disqualifying me, so I was in. I was finally told the next week, by the Leadership 2 teacher, that I got elected, so I quickly went home to make a victory video, where I edited myself into the Oval Office. Once it was told to the entire school, I released the video, and it quickly gained a ton of views, to the point where my electoral campaign achieved legendary status at Redmond Middle School.
