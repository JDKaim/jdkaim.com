## Volunteering in China
In the summers of 2018 and 2019, I went over to China to participate in a volunteering program.
In China, they have a program where volunteers can come in and teach Chinese students about their culture,
and I decided that it would be a great thing to do. I prepared slide decks beforehand, complete with pictures 
and videos, and practiced them for weeks before going to China. It was difficult to learn exactly how to
present the slides, as I would be presenting them in English, but some of the students were older, and some
younger, so the English fluency would vary. In China, I presented the PowerPoints, and made some friends
while I was there. Some of those friends I still keep in touch with. I did the same in 2019.
