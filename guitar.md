## Background
When I was in the 5th grade, I began to play guitar, and had weekly lessons throughout the year. I wasn't passionate for guitar yet, so when the school year ended, I put the guitar down and focused on other pursuits, but I came back to it when I was in the 8th grade, and have been playing ever since.

## Election Video
When I was in the 8th grade, I ran for Freshman Representative. At the time, I really liked Green Day and began to learn to play some of their songs.
I realized that the campaign was the perfect opportunity to publish a recording of me playing a Green Day song,
so published a campaign video of me performing "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)."

## Talent Show
I have always enjoyed listening to Death Cab For Cutie, and in Pre-COVID 2020, I saw them live at the Showbox in Seattle. Watching them perform "I Will Follow You Into The Dark" is still a memory that I cherish to this day. 
In 2021, I participated in the Redmond High School Talent Show.
I wanted to play something that I held close to heart, so I performed "I Will Follow You Into The Dark" by Death Cab for Cutie.

## Original Songs
Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic, I began writing songs, some of which I recorded using GarageBand by connecting my phone to an external microphone and guitar amp.
