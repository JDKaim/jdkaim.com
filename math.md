## Background
I would consider math to be a passion of mine. I have competed in many math competitions over the years ever since I took part in my first regional competition back in the 4th grade. I have also always viewed math as one of my strong suits in school and am set to take AP Calculus BC in my Junior Year.

I view math as a very important subject for students to learn, and I have coached the Redmond Middle School Math Club since 9th grade, creating live YouTube streams throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure other kids get the coaching they need.

## Competitions
In middle school, I competed in the MATHCOUNTS competition, making it to the Chapter Round in 6th grade and the State Round in the 8th grade.

I have also competed in the AMC competition, making AIME in my 10th grade year.

## Coaching
I first began coaching the Redmond Middle School Math Club during the 2019-2020 school year, presenting in-person lectures to the students at Redmond Middle School after school ended.

When COVID-19 hit, we were no longer able to gather for coaching sessions. As a result, I set up a YouTube channel so that the RMS Math Club team could provide an accessible way for students to be able to learn math.

In the 2020-2021 school year, our school began using Microsoft Teams, so I coached online over Microsoft Teams calls along with our other coaches.
